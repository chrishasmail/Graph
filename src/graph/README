Project 1: Drawing A Bar Graph


This program will draw a graph based on input entered into the command line.
The input is organized in the following format: <width> <height> <data1>
<data2> <data3> ... <dataN> where <width> and <height> are going to
represent the width and height of the graph respectively.
<data1> through <dataN> will represent the value for each of the
bars in the bar graph. The data can be both floats and integers.

To use this program, enter the numbers into the command line that correspond
to the format given above. Then run the program, and your graph will appear.
